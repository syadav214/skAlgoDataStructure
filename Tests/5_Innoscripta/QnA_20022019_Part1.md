        Saudi Crown Prince in India LIVE: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin
        Salman has been accorded the ceremonial reception with a guard of honour
        at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he was received by President Ram Nath
        Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prince, MBS as he is
        popularly known, will meet Modi later today, with his business mission
        under threat of being overshadowed by soaring tensions between India and
        Pakistan. The crown prince, who wants to persuade the world's fastest
        growing major economy to consume more Saudi oil, was greeted at the
        airport last night by Modi, who gave his traditional bear hug for honoured
        guests. The prince arrived from a two-day stay in Pakistan amid tensions
        between the two countries over the Pulwama terror attack carried out by
        Pakistan-base Jaish-e-Mohammad group. The latest showdown between the
        nuclear-armed neighbours, which is causing mounting international concern,
        is expected to figure prominently in Prince Mohammed's talks with Modi.
        "Our objective is to try to de-escalate tensions between the two
        countries, neighbouring countries, and to see if there is a path forward
        to resolving those differences peacefully," Saudi minister of state Adel
        al-Jubeir had said in Islamabad on Monday.
