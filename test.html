      Saudi Crown Prince in India LIVE: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin
      Salman has been accorded the ceremonial reception with a guard of honour
      at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he was received by President Ram Nath
      Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prince, MBS as he is
      popularly known, will meet Modi later today, with his business mission
      under threat of being overshadowed by soaring tensions between India and
      Pakistan. The crown prince, who wants to persuade the world's fastest
      growing major economy to consume more Saudi oil, was greeted at the
      airport last night by Modi, who gave his traditional bear hug for honoured
      guests. The prince arrived from a two-day stay in Pakistan amid tensions
      between the two countries over the Pulwama terror attack carried out by
      Pakistan-base Jaish-e-Mohammad group. The latest showdown between the
      nuclear-armed neighbours, which is causing mounting international concern,
      is expected to figure prominently in Prince Mohammed's talks with Modi.
      "Our objective is to try to de-escalate tensions between the two
      countries, neighbouring countries, and to see if there is a path forward
      to resolving those differences peacefully," Saudi minister of state Adel
      al-Jubeir had said in Islamabad on Monday.
